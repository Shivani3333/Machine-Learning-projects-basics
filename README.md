Stock Market Data Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Description

This project performs a detailed analysis of stock market data (e.g., Amazon, Alphabet Inc., etc.) by reading CSV files, checking for missing values, and visualizing the data. The script also provides an automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the ydata_profiling library (formerly known as pandas-profiling).

### Key features of the project:
- Load and manipulate multiple CSV files containing stock market data.
- Visualize missing values using the missingno library.
- Perform automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) with ydata_profiling.
- Convert the date column into a standardized format.
- Check for null values and visualize them.
  
## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure to install the required Python libraries. You can do this by using the following command:

bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib plotly missingno ydata-profiling


Required Libraries:
glob: For handling multiple CSV files.
pandas: For data manipulation.
numpy: For mathematical operations.
seaborn: For data visualization.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
plotly: For interactive plotting.
missingno: For visualizing missing values in the dataset.
ydata-profiling: For performing automated exploratory data analysis (formerly known as pandas-profiling).

pip install glob pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib plotly missingno ydata-profiling

How to Run the Script
Place your stock market CSV files (e.g., Amazon.com_Inc.stock[1].csv) in the same directory as the script.
Run the Python script to load and analyze the stock data.
The script will output basic data information, visualize missing values, and generate a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) report using ydata_profiling.

Example of CSV File Used:
Amazon.com_Inc.stock[1].csv
Make sure to modify the file path in the script if you are using a different dataset.
